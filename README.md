# Austin's Memory Game

Austin wanted to have a web game so we're making a memory match game with Austin's images on the back of the cards.  We'll start off with 12 pairs and make it adjustable later.

Stuff to do:

1.  Make the amount of pairs adjustable.

2.  Style the page

3.  Add a turn counter on the page

4.  Change some of the images

5.  Add a favicon
